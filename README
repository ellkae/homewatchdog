Home Watchdog is a web-enabled home automation framework.

It is my 2011 senior project for Western Washington University, EET department.

Microcontroller: K60N512 ARM Cortex-M4
Operating System: MQX RTOS

Because of licensing, I will only be providing the code for my project.
The operating system was free, courtesy of Freescale with my MCU. The download is 
hidden behind a licensing agreement that you must accept.
