<h1>About Home WatchDog</h1>
<p>Home WatchDog is a web-enabled home automation framework.</p>

<h4>Ok, so what does that mean?</h4>
<p>It means that Home WatchDog creates the foundation for interfacing with appliances and devices in the house. Web-enabled means that you can control and monitor them over the internet.</p>

<h4>...and "framework"</h4>
<p>Control over the internet is really a simple concept. However, it can be intimidating for someone who doesn't quite know where to begin. My goal was to create a solid foundation for someone who wants their project to have control or monitoring over the internet and attempt to flatten out the learning curve for those who believe that you bsolutely need Computer Science experience to attempt this.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is T.J. Telan</p>

<h4>What kind of related experience did I have before this?</h4>
<p>A lot, actually. I am double majoring in Electronics Engineering Technology and Computer Science (I'm also minoring in Math...). Currently, I am the Server Administrator for WWU University Residences, where I manage a handful of FreeBSD servers that keep Housing, Dining and Admissions running smoothly. </p>

<h4>Why did I design this?</h4>
<p>For a handful of reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Save money (in the long run). Similar products on the market cost a lot of money for equipment and subscriptions and do not give me the ability to customize the look and feel.</li>
    <li>I wanted experience with ARM architecture while its use in the market is gaining momentum</li>
    <li>To contribute to the Open-Source movement by distributing my schematics and source code under the Creative Commons licensing</li>
    <li>Encourage future Seniors in the program to extend the functionality by using my project as a component of their own.</li>
    <li>For the learning experience. My initial experience of taking a concept to prototype was very unique. Fast paced. Very fun.</li>
    <li>For the teaching experience. Honestly, I think my project is pretty cool, and I want other people to be interested in how it works and be encouraged to go to my paged on <a href="https://github.com/ellkae/homewatchdog">GitHub</a>, download the code and learn how it works. I am doing my best to make it easy for someone to get started.</li>
</ul>
